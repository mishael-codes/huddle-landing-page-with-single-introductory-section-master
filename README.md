## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

### What I learned

I improved my knowledge of the bootstrap css framework. For example, I learned how to add borders on elements using the `border` class, create a rounded/curved border using the `border` class and so on.

### Continued development

I want to keep on improving my knowledge of bootstrap and to do this, I'll try my best and look for ways in which I can incorporate bootstrap in my future projects.
